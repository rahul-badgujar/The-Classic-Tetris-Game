Finally an update of the Halo font.  It's been updated to match the
logos of Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo Wars and the Halo 2 ad run before
release.  I've also revised some letters and numbers I never liked.
If you have any problems with the font, email me or try my website.

Obviously the font is free.  Please do whatever you want with it.
If you like it or find a problem with it drop me a line.  If you
would like something added please ask though I think I have most of
it this time.

How to use in Windows:

First unzip the font into a folder that you can find again (like C:\temp).  Now go to Control Panel, Fonts.  Next File, Install New Font.  The font window will open and you will have to find the folder that you unzipped it to in the Folders box on the lower left.  Once you check the folder, the font should appear in the List of Fonts box.  Select the font and click OK.  Close the font window and you should now be able to use the font in any Windows program.
